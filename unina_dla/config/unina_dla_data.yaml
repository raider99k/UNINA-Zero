# FSG Cone Dataset Configuration for UNINA-DLA

# Path configuration - UPDATE THE 'path' VARIABLE to your absolute dataset location
path: ~/Documents/AS_IA_STUFF_S25/dataset_FINALE_UNITO
train: train/images  # train images (relative to 'path')
val: valid/images    # val images (relative to 'path')
test: images/test # test images (optional)

# Classes
names:
  0: big_orange_cone
  1: little_orange_cone
  2: blue_cone
  3: yellow_cone

# Number of classes
nc: 4

# DLA Requirements - Static Shapes
# Unlike standard YOLO, we MUST enforce strict resizing to avoid DLA dynamic shape errors
imgsz: 640  # inference size (pixels)

# Hardware-Aware Augmentations
# We disable extensive color jittering for distillation to keep teacher/student feature distributions closer
hsv_h: 0.015  # image HSV-Hue augmentation (fraction)
hsv_s: 0.1  # REDUCED: image HSV-Saturation augmentation (fraction) - was 0.7
hsv_v: 0.1  # REDUCED: image HSV-Value augmentation (fraction) - was 0.4
degrees: 0.0  # image rotation (+/- deg)
translate: 0.1  # image translation (+/- fraction)
scale: 0.2  # REDUCED: image scale (+/- gain) - was 0.5
shear: 0.0  # image shear (+/- deg)
perspective: 0.0  # image perspective (+/- fraction), range 0-0.001
flipud: 0.0  # image flip up-down (probability)
fliplr: 0.5  # image flip left-right (probability)
mosaic: 0.2  # REDUCED: image mosaic (probability) - was 1.0 (Too strong for distillation matching)
mixup: 0.0  # DISABLED: image mixup (probability) - was 0.1 (Harmful for feature matching)
copy_paste: 0.0  # segment copy-paste (probability)
